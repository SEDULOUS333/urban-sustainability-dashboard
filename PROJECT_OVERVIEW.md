# Urban Sustainability Dashboard

## Introduction
The Urban Sustainability Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to help cities, communities, and stakeholders monitor, analyze, and collaborate on key sustainability metrics. It provides real-time insights into air quality, water usage, energy consumption, waste management, and traffic, as well as a community hub for discussion and collaboration.

## Real-World Problem Addressed
Modern cities face complex challenges in managing resources, reducing pollution, and engaging citizens in sustainability efforts. Data is often siloed, hard to interpret, or inaccessible to the public. This dashboard addresses these issues by:
- Centralizing critical urban sustainability data in one place
- Visualizing trends and anomalies for quick decision-making
- Enabling community engagement and knowledge sharing
- Supporting data-driven policy and behavioral change

## How the Dashboard Works
- **Data Collection:** The backend aggregates and stores data on air quality, water, energy, waste, and traffic, either from sensors, APIs, or manual input.
- **Visualization:** The frontend presents this data in interactive charts, maps, and tables, making it easy to understand and act upon.
- **Authentication:** Users register and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.
- **Community Hub:** Authenticated users can post messages, share ideas, and collaborate on sustainability initiatives.
- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Overview
- **Frontend:**
  - Built with React and Material-UI (MUI) for a modern, responsive UI
  - Uses Axios for API requests
  - Environment variables configure the backend API URL for flexibility
  - Handles authentication tokens via localStorage
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API endpoints
  - MongoDB for data storage (models for users, posts, air quality, water, energy, waste, traffic, etc.)
  - JWT for secure authentication
  - CORS configured for cross-origin requests
  - Deployed on Render for scalability
- **Key Features:**
  - Modular code structure (separate routes, models, middleware)
  - Community hub for user engagement
  - Real-time or regularly updated sustainability data

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. **Backend setup:**
   - Install dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Configure environment variables (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.)
   - Start the server: `npm start`
3. **Frontend setup:**
   - Install dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` to your backend URL
   - Start the frontend: `npm start`
4. **Access the dashboard:**
   - Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed frontend URL)
